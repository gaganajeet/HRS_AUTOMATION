1.Objective:

Ensure that the new feature allowing users to filter out hotels with low availability is implemented correctly and functions as expected.

2.Scope:

The test plan will focus specifically on testing the functionality related to filtering out hotels based on availability using the Booking API.


2.1 In Scope:

Filtering Functionality:

Testing the ability of users to filter hotels based on availability levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
Ensuring that the filter options are displayed correctly and are accessible to users.

Accuracy of Filtering:
Verifying that hotels with the specified availability level are accurately filtered out from the search results.
Testing the precision of filtering under various availability scenarios.

Integration with Booking API:
Ensuring seamless integration of the new filtering feature with the existing Booking API functionality.
Testing compatibility with different API endpoints and parameters.

2.2 Out of Scope:

Booking Process:
The actual booking process itself, including selecting dates, making reservations, and payment transactions, is out of scope for this feature.

Hotel Inventory Management:
Managing hotel inventory or availability data at the backend system level is not within the scope of this feature.

3. Testing Environment:

Use a dedicated testing environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible to conduct the tests without affecting the live system.

4.Test Cases:

  a. Positive Test Cases:

  Verify that hotels with high availability are displayed when the user selects the appropriate filter option.
  Test filtering hotels by different levels of availability (e.g., high, medium, low) to ensure accuracy.
  Confirm that hotels with low availability are excluded from search results when the corresponding filter is applied.


  b. Negative Test Cases:
  Test the system's response when no hotels meet the selected availability criteria.
  Verify error handling when invalid filter parameters are provided.
  Ensure that the system gracefully handles unexpected errors or exceptions during filtering.

5.Test Data:
Prepare a variety of test data sets with different hotel availability scenarios to cover a range of testing scenarios effectively.
Include data with high, medium, and low availability for various hotels to validate the filtering mechanism under different conditions.

6.Test Execution:
  Execute each test case systematically, recording the results and any deviations from expected behavior.
  Use automated testing tools where possible to streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.

7.Reporting:
  Document test results, including any issues encountered during testing and their resolutions.
  Provide clear and concise feedback on the performance and functionality of the new feature.

8.Roles and Responsibility:

8.1 Test Manager:

   Oversees the entire testing effort and is responsible for planning, organizing, and coordinating testing activities.
   Defines testing strategies, objectives, and timelines in alignment with project goals.
   Allocates resources, assigns tasks, and monitors progress to ensure timely and effective test execution.
8.2 Test Lead:

    Assists the test manager in planning and coordinating testing activities.
    Leads the testing team, assigns tasks, and ensures that testing objectives are met.
8.3 Test Analyst/Test Engineer:

    Develops test plans, test cases, and test data sets based on project requirements and specifications.

8.4 Automation Engineer:

    Designs, develops, and maintains automated test scripts to streamline testing processes and improve efficiency.
8.5 DevOps Engineer:

    Manages test environments, including setup, configuration, and maintenance of testing infrastructure.
    Implements continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
